**About this template**

The main file that coordinates the execution of this reproducible project is `Makefile.R`. This file contains commands to set up global R packages and to execute the project files. You may choose to run R scripts, R Markdown, or Quarto files.

The project files should be modular and self-contained. Each file should be able to run independently of the others. The `Makefile.R` file should be able to run each file in the project.

The entire project can be executed by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
R CMD Rscript Makefile.R
```
